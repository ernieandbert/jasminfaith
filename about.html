      <h3 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">a 2016 graduate designer at Atlassian!</h3>

      <p class="about text-center">I've loved technology from since I can first remember. My first Playstation, my first Gameboy, my first computer. Had you given me a barbie doll as a kid, I'd have said "Oh, thanks..." and never touched it again, but a new game and I'd bounce around the house before running over and collapsing into my bean bag not to be heard from for the next few hours. Pokemon, Tomb Raider, Sly Racoon, Tony Hawk, Crash Bandicoot... The only game I never really got into was Worms and I still don't like it to this day. </p>

      <br/>

      <p class="about text-center about">As I grew up, I pretty much stayed the same - except the technology became cooler. Gone were the days of yonder with my Playstation One and Gameboy Color, in its replacement I found Adobe's Creative Suite, next-gen Playstations, Frankie & Oyster Magazines and the ruler that is PC gaming. Through high school I focussed all my efforts towards my art, architecture and film & television classes, and yet after my first year at university I thought I wanted to be a business analyst. </p>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <p class="text-center quote">A job where I'm counting down the minutes and seconds until I can leave is not where I saw myself being in 5 years</p>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <p class="about text-center about">Luckily though, that phase didn't last long, and I am eternally grateful for my cadetship with the Department of Human Services for opening my eyes.
      During my project management class at university, I placed in the top 10 of students in the class. I know for a fact I'd probably be a pretty alright project manager. But I also now know that I'd be bored out of my mind. And a job where I'm counting down the minutes and seconds until I can leave is not where I saw myself being in 5 years.</p>

      <br/>

      <p class="about text-center about">Instead, I started focusing on my Visual Media Design major, and lo and behold, I loved the work I was doing. Graphic design, typography design, games design, web design, 3D design. Design, design, design. I loved it. My GPA started rising (not that it was bad to begin with) and I started to really enjoy the time I was putting into my assignments. Gone were the days of leaving my assignments until the last minute which left me with less stress and more time to relax without thoughts of assignments looming over my head.</p>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <p class="text-center quote">most importantly I still love 90's cartoons and pokemon... I still have my original Rayquaza from Pokemon Emerald... We celebrated 10 years together this past June</p>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <p class="about text-center about">Now, coming into my final semester at university I know what I want from life. I'm still that same nerdy kid who would rather play playstation than go out and practice cartwheels with the other girls (something which I still cannot to this day do). And most importantly I still love 90's cartoons and pokemon. In fact I still have my original Rayquaza from Pokemon Emerald as part of my Pokemon Alpha team. We celebrated 10 years together this past June. Others too (but everyone knows Rayquaza is the best legendary). That said, I've also matured greatly from my experiences. I've given back to my community by being a mentor for first year Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander students, as well as first year Bachelor of Information Technology students. And I've even gone out to state schools to work with year 11 and 12 students helping them realise what they want to do after their time at school is over.</p>

      <br/>

      <p class="about text-center about">I've learnt a lot during my four years at university, my time mentoring only cementing my want to be a designer. But more than that I've managed to squeeze in an Italian elective, learn to play guitar, learn to write calligraphy, not to mention all the skills and information I've learnt through my actual degree. I've made amazing friends, gained 3 years of experience with a Government agency, gained experience working for start-ups through my internship at Silicon Lakes. I've participated in 3 hack-a-thons, attended 7 festivals and landed a graduate position at an amazing global company.</p>

      <br/>

      <p class="about text-center about" style="padding-bottom: 50px;">So I guess that's about it. 21 years summed up into 800 or so words. If you've made if this far you deserve a prize, congratulations! I'm sorry but that's about the only prize I can give you. If you have any questions, or just want to chat in general feel free to shoot me a message. Just head over to the contact page <a href="contact.html"><em>here</em></a>.</p>
